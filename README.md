# Warehouse-bot dispatcher

Untrusted input is an order; it can only ever become one of a fixed set of decisions over a
closed type, never a tool argument. An injected instruction cannot be represented in the
closed type, so it is rejected — proven at compile time by `check`, and clamped again at
run time by the `extract` domain check.

- **Untrusted input:** `fetch<web>` — an order
- **Closed type:** `type Decision = Pick(Bin) | Hold` where `Bin` is closed
- **Sink / capability:** `grant pick` → `privileged { pick(d) }`
- **Consequence axes:** Trust

## Run the demo

```sh
examples/apps/warehouse-bot/demo.sh
```

The safe agent proves `SAFE`, runs on a benign input, and **rejects an injection
payload at the trust boundary (exit 3)**. The vulnerable version proves `UNSAFE` — it
never compiles to a runnable agent.

## Files

- `warehouse-bot_safe.eide` — the correct design.
- `warehouse-bot_unsafe.eide` — the tempting-but-wrong version (the negative example a model must learn to reject).
- `eidos.toml` — the project manifest (each app is a self-contained Eidos project).
